# boerenbridge_cpp

To build this C++ project from scratch on a clean PC, you'll need to follow these steps:

Setup C++ Development Environment:

Install a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler.
Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor like Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks.
Create Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your project.
download the project from github and copy the header and cpp files to your directory

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project directory.
Compile your C++ files using the chosen compiler. For example, using GCC:

g++ -std=c++11 src/*.cpp -o mygame

Here, -std=c++11 specifies the C++ version (you can change it based on your requirements), src/*.cpp indicates all .cpp files in the src directory, and -o mygame specifies the output executable name.
Run the Executable:

After successful compilation, you'll get an executable file (e.g., mygame).
Run the executable:

./mygame
